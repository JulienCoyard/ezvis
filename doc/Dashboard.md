All dashboard settings are inside a `dashboard` key.

At the moment, there is only the `charts` setting. There are several types of charts:

- [histogram](Histogram.md)
- [horizontalbars](HorizontalBars.md)
- [pie](Pie.md)
- [network](Network.md)
- [map](Map.md)

All the declared charts are displayed in the ezVIS' home page: the dashboard.
